    "As a user of the Intelligence Layer (IL), I want to evaluate how well different configurations perform on a QA task with the given input data.\n",
    "A configuration is a combination of a model with a fixed set of parameters.\n",
    "In the following, we focus on comparing setups which differ only in the chosen model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide multiple inputs consisting of a longer texts and a questions related to each of those texts, as well as the expected answers.\n",
    "A Llama-model is used as a grader to decide which answer of two different models is better.\n",
    "The aggregation of all comparisons results in [ELO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) scores and win rates of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we go through the following steps: First, we create a set of examples of texts with a relevant question for each (Step 0), after which we use the models to generate answers (Step 1). The given answers are then compared against each other and judged by the Llama model (Step 2), which will result in a final ELO ranking and win rate (Step 3). Lastly, we include a new model in the evaluation without having to re-evaluate the previous models against each other, as is typically done in ELO rankings (Step 4).\n",
